A successful add Question Topic should remove the topic from the accordion
Question topics restored from local store should not appear in the add Question accordion

Adding a shared topicId seeded with exercise '1234' should not affect whether
or not that topicId is available in a manually created exercise '1234'.

This should remain true whether the shared exercise is created by URL entry or retrieved from the questionStore.
